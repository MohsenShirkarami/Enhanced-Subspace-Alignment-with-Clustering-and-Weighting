#Enhanced Subspace Alignment with Clustering and Weighting for Cross-Subject Multi-Session EEG-based Emotion Recognition
In this [paper](Enhanced_Subspace_Alignment_with_Clustering_and_Weighting_for_Cross_Subject_Multi_Session_EEG_based_Emotion_Recognition.pdf), we proposed an extended version of the Subspace Alignment method for Domain Adaptation utilizing the clustering of source subjects. This method can make an effective choice between the available data from the source domain by clustering the source subjects based on the behavioral similarity of their EEG signals. This effective selection among the subjects and the idea of purposeful data weighting have caused the final model to represent the space of the target subject more effectively. Experimental results on the SEED dataset show that the presented method outperforms several state-of-the-art models.
